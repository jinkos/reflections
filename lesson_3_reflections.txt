When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want access from different computers or multiple people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I'd be worried about it overwriting local stuff that I have changed

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks - it's a git hub thing that copies other people's repositories onto your own GitHub
cloning - copying a repository locally or from GitHub
branching - that's the meat of Git. You edit your code on a branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It's like knowing the branch node of two different branches and give your merge program something to work on
